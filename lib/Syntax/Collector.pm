=head1 NAME

Syntax::Collector - collect a bundle of modules into one

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In lib/Example/ProjectX/Syntax.pm

   package Example::ProjectX::Syntax;
   
   use 5.010;
   our $VERSION = 1;
   
   use Syntax::Collector q/
      use strict 0;
      use warnings 0;
      use feature 0 ':5.10';
      use Scalar::Util 1.21 qw(blessed);
   /;
   
   1;
   __END__

In projectx.pl:

   #!/usr/bin/perl
   
   use Example::ProjectX::Database;
   use Example::ProjectX::Syntax 1;
   # strict, warnings, feature ':5.10', etc are now enabled!
   
   say "Welcome to ProjectX";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl is such a flexible language that the language itself can be extended
from within. (Though much of the more interesting stuff needs XS hooks like
L<Devel::Declare>.)

One problem with this is that it often requires a lot of declarations at the
top of your code, loading various syntax extensions. The L<syntax> module on
CPAN addresses this somewhat by allowing you to load a bunch of features in
one line, provided each syntax feature implements the necessary API:

   use syntax qw/io maybe perform/;

However this introduces problems of its own. If we look at the code above,
it is non-obvious that it requires L<Syntax::Feature::Io>,
L<Syntax::Feature::Maybe> and L<Syntax::Feature::Perform>, which makes
it difficult for automated tools such as L<Module::Install> to automatically
calculate your code's dependencies.

Syntax::Collector to the rescue!

   package Example::ProjectX::Syntax;
   use 5.010;
   use Syntax::Collector q/
   use strict 0;
   use warnings 0;
   use feature 0 ':5.10';
   use Scalar::Util 1.21 qw(blessed);
   /;

When you C<use Syntax::Collector>, you provide a list of modules to
"collect" into a single package (notice the C<< q/.../ >>). This list
of modules looks like a big string of Perl code that is going to be
passed to C<eval>, but don't let that fool you - it is not.

Each line must conform to the following pattern:

   (use|no) MODULENAME VERSION (OTHERSTUFF)? ;

(Actually hash comments, and blank lines are also allowed.) The semantics
of all that is pretty much what you'd expect, except that when MODULENAME
begins with "Syntax::Feature::" it's treated with some DWIMmery, and
C<install> is called instead of C<import>. Note that VERSION is required,
but if you don't care which version of a module you use, it's fine to
set VERSION to 0. (Yes, VERSION is even required for pragmata.)

Now, you ask... why stuff all that structured data into a string, and
parse it out again? Because to naive lexical analysis (e.g.
L<Module::Install>) it really looks like a bunch of "use" lines, and
not just a single quoted string. This helps tools calculate the
dependencies of your collection; and thus the dependencies of other
code that uses your collection.

As well as providing an C<import> method for your collection,
Syntax::Collector also provides a C<modules> method, which can be called
to find out which modules a collection includes. Called in list context,
it returns a list. Called in scalar context, it returns a reference to a
C<< { module => version } >> hash.

=head2 Exporting

Syntax::Collector will also make your class inherit from L<Exporter::Tiny>
so that in addition to collecting up a bunch of features from other
modules, your syntax collection can also export its own functions.

   package Example::ProjectX::Syntax;
   
   use 5.010;
   our $VERSION = 1;
   
   use Syntax::Collector q/
     use strict 0;
     use warnings 0;
     use feature 0 ':5.10';
     use Scalar::Util 1.21 qw(blessed);
   /;
   
   our @EXPORT = qw( foo bar );
   
   sub foo { ... }
   
   1;
   __END__

=head2 Import Options

Modules importing your syntax collection can suppress particular lines:

   use Example::ProjectX::Syntax qw( -warnings );

Or provide alternative import options:

   use Example::ProjectX::Syntax
      '-Scalar::Util' => [qw/ blessed refaddr /];

See also L<Exporter::Tiny>.
